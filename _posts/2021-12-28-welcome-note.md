Hey, welcome to my personal blog page. I will share my thoughts and ideas on this website with you. The articles might be simple how-to articles, but also off-topic stuff.
Feel free to leave a comment in the comments section and get in contact with me via the contact form, direct email or social media.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

	def print_hi(name)
	  puts "Hi, #{name}"
	end
	print_hi('Tom')
	#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
